# A DCI-inspired Approach For Java

Inspired from Andreas SÃ¶derlund's DCI tutorial for TypeScript: https://blog.encodeart.dev/series/dci-typescript-tutorial

If you are new to Data-Context-Interaction, then it's recommended you read the following article first:

Please note that given Java's dynamic limitations and the considerations mentioned below, this is not true DCI.

DCI is a valuable (but not very well known) use case oriented design & architecture approach 
and OOP paradigm shift. Due to its particular characteristics, it's rather difficult to implement in a strongly typed 
programming language like Java. Two reference examples have been provided by DCI's authors, one using a library called 
Qi4J and the other using Java's reflection API: https://fulloo.info/Examples/JavaExamples/ 

In my case, I'm going for some tradeoffs: this is not "pure" DCI, but still aiming to be as close as possible to 
the valuable features DCI brings.

Prior considerations:
- Pure Java for roles/role-injection - no third party libraries / frameworks, as they might not be accepted in certain projects
- No reflection - this also might not be accepted in some projects, and Java's reflection API is a pain to work with
- Able to integrate in a mature/legacy code base, i.e. not requiring any changes to existing entities.

Approach taken for roles: methods with a naming convention.

An actual role method might look something like this:

com.alexbalmus.dcibankaccounts.dcicontexts.moneytransfer.SourceToDestinationTransferContext.source_transferToDestination:

    // Source role:
    void source_transferToDestination(Double amount)
    {
        if (source.getBalance() < amount)
        {
            throw new BalanceException(INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS); // Rollback.
        }
        source.decreaseBalanceBy(amount);

        // equivalent of: destination.receive(amount):
        destination_receive(amount);
    }

When calling this, i.e. source_transferToDestination(amount), it would be the equivalent of doing: source.transferToDestination(amount)

The context would select the objects participating in the use case and call the necessary role methods:

com.alexbalmus.dcibankaccounts.dcicontexts.moneytransfer.SourceToDestinationTransferContext.perform:

    /**
     * DCI context enactment
     */
    public void perform()
    {
        //----- Interaction:

        // equivalent of: source.transferToDestination(amount)
        source_transferToDestination(amount);
    }
